# Udacity Logs Analysis Project
3rd Project for Udacity's [Fullstack Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).

## Project Details:
#### Task

*You've been hired onto a team working on a newspaper site. The user-facing newspaper site frontend itself, and the database behind it, are already built and running. You've been asked to build an __internal reporting tool__ that will use information from the database to discover what kind of articles the site's readers like.*

*The database contains newspaper articles, as well as the web server log for the site. The log has a database row for each time a reader loaded a web page. Using that information, your code will answer questions about the site's user activity.*

*The program you write in this project will run from the command line. It won't take any input from the user. Instead, it will connect to that database, use SQL queries to analyze the log data, and print out the answers to some questions.*

#### Questions to Answer:
1. __What are the most popular three articles of all time?__ Which articles have been accessed the most? Present this information as a sorted list with the most popular article at the top.

2. __Who are the most popular article authors of all time?__ That is, when you sum up all of the articles each author has written, which authors get the most page views? Present this as a sorted list with the most popular author at the top

3. __On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?__ The log table includes a column status that indicates the HTTP status code that the news site sent to the user's browser.

## Setup:

__Required Software:__
- [Python 3.6.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [PostgreSQL 9.6.x](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [pyscopg2 2.7.3.2](http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/install.html)

__Virtual Machine:__
1. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)
2. Install [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org)
3. Udacity provides the virtual machine configuration needed to run this project. Clone the git repository found [here](https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm)
4. Using the terminal, navigate to the /vagrant folder and run ``` vagrant up ``` to initialize vm.

__Database Setup:__
1. Download the database setup files found [here](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/August/57b5f748_newsdata/newsdata.zip)
2. Unzip _newsdata.zip_ to retrieve _newsdata.sql_.
3. Run _newsdata.sql_ using this command
``` psql -d news -f newsdata.sql ```

## Running the Project:
1. Type command ``` vagrant ssh ``` to log into virtual machine.
2. Navigate to project folder ``` cd /vagrant/Udacity-Logs-Analysis-Project ```
3. Run ``` python logsAnalysis.py ```

## Expected Result:
After running the python file and waiting a few moments, you should see the following in your terminal:
